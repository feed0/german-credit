[Anton Markov et al (Credit scoring methods: Latest trends and points to consider, 2022)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405918822000095) suggest that University of California Irvine's datasets are among the most popular public sources for credit score modeling. I have chosen the [UCI German Credit Data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/144/statlog+german+credit+data) to begin with.
